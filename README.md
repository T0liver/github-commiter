# GitHub Commiter
A code which can be run with cron job and commit to github every day.

I'm trying to write it in more and more languages so there will be not just the main branch and if so it will be not up-to-date as I don't want to mix the languages.

## Implementations
Here is the list of the current implementations with links to the braches:

### C
